                    "Malibu Icebergs is a community-led proposal to bring an ocean pool to the Malibu landscape.
                    Ocean pools have been described as a spiritual experience. They have became popularized in Australian culture and brought to numerous countries across the globe but have yet to be introduced in California.

                    The introduction of such a facility brings something entirely new to the region: a unique recreational experience with the iconic allure of Malibu.""

                    The ocean pool will seamlessly integrate with Malibuâ€™s natural beauty, offering a safe and environmentally conscious way to enjoy ocean swimming. Featuring a stunning, architecturally designed structure that blends with the landscape, the pool will provide year-round access to a quintessentially Californian experience.

                    Hi, I'm Rosie. I'm a software engineer, digital nomad, Francophile, Australia enthusiast, and multimedia artist. In 2022 my travels took my to Sydney, Australia, where I discovered the
                    marvel of ocean pools. After seeing one in person, I began to think - how on Earth could we not have one of these in the States?!
                    <p></p>
                    As a longtime Los Angeles resident, I couldn't think of a better place to introduce the concept than on the California coast. I started doing more research on ocean pools,
                    reached out to architects experts from all over the world, and the idea for Malibu Icebergs was born.
                    <p></p>
                    I hope you'll join me on this journey to build the first ocean pool in the United States. If you want to get involved, don't be a stranger - I'd love to hear from you!
