                            Ocean pools have been described as a spiritual experience. They have become popularized in Australian culture and brought to numerous countries across the globe but have yet to be introduced in California.
                        </p>

                        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">Malibu Icebergs is a community-led proposal and public health initiative with the goal of developing an ocean pool on the Malibu landscape.
                            The introduction of such a facility brings something entirely new to the region: a unique
                            recreational experience with the iconic allure of Malibu.</p>

                        Ocean pools enhance public health by offering ocean access while safeguarding swimmers from rocks and hazardous marine life. They provide an authentic open-water swimming experience within a controlled setting.
                        With sustainable design and accessibility as core tenets, the ocean pool will seamlessly integrate
                        with Malibuâ€™s natural beauty, offering a safe and environmentally conscious way to enjoy ocean swimming.
                        <br /><br />
                        Featuring a stunning, architecturally designed structure that blends with the landscape, the pool will
                        provide year-round access to a quintessentially Californian experience while promoting public health
                        by encouraging physical activity and providing a safe alternative to open-water swimming.
